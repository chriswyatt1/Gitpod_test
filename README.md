# Gitpod_test
Testing gitpod integration

To run this gitpod, you need to append gitpod.io/# to the https URL of the github repo to run.

For Nextflow training this would be : 
gitpod.io/#https://github.com/chriswyatt1/Gitpod_test/

Then Nextflow is installed and the tutorial data downloaded within the task commands.
